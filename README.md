# ImageMagick tool
A small CLI based tool for Windows that can write text onto images<br><br>
It uses ImageMagick (obviously), so you need to have that installed and set in the environment variables path<br>
I do not own ImageMagick, I have only used the provided tools to help me with this program<br>
<br>
It works best with portrait images, but could be edited simply to cater for landscape images better instead<br>

It can do better if tuned to the specific images
